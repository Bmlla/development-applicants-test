# ALLOG Development Test
Welcome applicants!

We garantee that it will be a nice test.

# What you have to do
- Consume any weather API (some examples: https://dzone.com/articles/4-free-weather-providers-api-to-develop-weather-ap-1)
- Make a nice frontend to show us your UI/UX skills
- Make a humanized, reusable and testable backend to show us your code-organization and code-logic
- Tests, tests, tests

# Requirements
- You **have 48 hours** from PULL REQUEST until MERGE
- We would like to see our stack been used (_A lot of JS, including AngularJS, Node.JS and stuff_). But, you can choose your own. (**Our Software Developement Coordinator does not like JAVA, btw**)
- Here, we use VSCode to build awesome software. So, we need a workspace to open in our IDE. Bring everthing you need.

# Important
We love coding! So, make sure to write beautiful lines.  
We'll appreaciate that and check every single piece of code that you wrote and talk about it later, so you can explain to us your babies.  
We are looking forward to see your coding skills.  

# DAMN, We almost forgot
We're an agile team, so we need to see some Sprint Backlog and tasks. It could be printed, on Trello, or a photo of your Kanban. :)
