# ALLOG Development Test
Welcome applicants!

We garantee that it will be a nice test.

### What you have to do
- Consume any weather API (some examples: https://dzone.com/articles/4-free-weather-providers-api-to-develop-weather-ap-1).
- Make a nice frontend to show us your UI/UX skills.
- Make a humanized, reusable and testable backend to show us your code-organization and code-logic.
- Tests, tests, tests (_a simple "pass" or "fail" information is good enough for us_).

### Some Functions (must-have)
- Option to save current weather and observation.
- Option to list saved weather with city, date, weather and observation.
- Search weather by city and/or date.
- Option to delete a saved weather.

### Requirements
- You have **72 hours** starting from fork this repo.
- We would like to see our stack been used (_A lot of JS, including **AngularJS**, **Node.js** and stuff_). But, you can choose your own. (**Our Software Development Coordinator does not like JAVA, btw**).
- Fork this repository and add your code and any assets to take a look at your work. Bring everthing you need.
- Here, we use **VSCode** to build awesome software. So, we need a workspace to open in our IDE. 

### Project Structure Example
```
    root folder
        frontend -> AngularJS code (or whatever)
        backend -> Node.js code (or whatever)
        data -> mongodump of your testing database
```

### Important
We love coding! So, make sure to write **beautiful lines**.  
We'll appreaciate that and check every single piece of code that you wrote and talk about it later, so you can explain to us **your babies**.  
We are looking forward to see your coding skills.  

### DAMN, We almost forgot
We're an **agile team**, so we need to see some **Sprint Backlog and tasks**. It could be printed, on **Trello**, or a photo of your Kanban. :)
